SNMP Trap Data Visualizer
=========================

This is the newest feature of NSTI 3.0 and it will be getting updated more in the future.  For now it is a simple way to visualize the overall trap data you have in your table to get a better overall view of what your traps are doing.  This combined with filters and the search function will make reading and troubleshooting trap data much easier.

Here is an example of the visualizer showing Severity:

*Visualizer will access all of the traps in your database and draw a bar and pie graph based on your traplist.*


The Future of the Visualizer 
----------------------------

Plans for updates to this feature are noted here, any suggestions and ideas would be very much appreciated so get them to us through github or email.

- Adding the ability to choose the type of graph you want to display (line, bar, pie, scatter)
- Choose the type of trap data to compare against a certain time period or date range
- The ability to limit the number of traps displayed by ID range, number, date, status, etc.
